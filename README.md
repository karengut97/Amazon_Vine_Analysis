## Summary: 

There does not appear to be a bias for the Vine program as evidenced by the 5-star percentage between paid (42%) and unpaid (53%). 

In addition, the total count of reviews is 61,948. Of these reviews, 99.5% of them are from non-Vine reviewers. This ovewhelming majority of non-paid reviewers removes any hint of bias towards the overall assessment.
